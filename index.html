<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome to the "JS-XMLRPC (XML-RPC for Javascript)" Homepage. It is a library implementing the <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/">XML-RPC</a> and <a href="https://www.jsonrpc.org">JSON-RPC</a> protocols, written in Javascript.<br/>
It is designed for ease of use, flexibility and completeness.<br/>
Above all, it mimics as closely as possible the API of the <a href="https://gggeek.github.io/phpxmlrpc/">PHPXMLRPC</a> library.<br/><br/>
<b>Please note</b> that there is another, older javascript library named JSXMLRPC available on sf.net: <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/jsxmlrpc">http://sourceforge.net/projects/jsxmlrpc</a>. Both libraries share the same intents, but the code is completely unrelated.
</p>
