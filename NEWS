JS-XMLRPC version 0.4 - 2009/09/05

I'm pleased to announce the fourth release of the js-xmlrpc library.

A lot of bugs have been fixed since version 0.3, in many areas of encoding and
decoding xmlrpc values.

* added method setUserCredentials to xmlrpc_client, as the 'parent' php lib does in its latest version
* added support for the <ex:nil/> tag from the apache library, both in input and output (output regulated by the xmlrpc_null_apache_encoding variable, input by thexmlrpc_null_extension one)
* base64_decode now trims whitespace
* updated bundled yui to version 2.5.0
* fixed a bug in error log handler when using firefox+firebug
* fixed a bug in xmlrpc_decode with structs 
* fixed a bug in parsing cookie headers in http responses
* allow lib to work in Windows Scripting Host environments 
* added two demo files, for WSH and VB
 
JS-XMLRPC version 0.3 - 2007/06/26

I'm pleased to announce the third release of the js-xmlrpc library.

A lot of bugs have been fixed since version 0.2, in many areas of encoding and
decoding xmlrpc values.

There is better support for Firefox when setting debug mode to clients, and for
Safari when the port is not specified in the server url.
The debug and error logging mechanism has been rewritten, and will take advantage
of Firebug when detected.
The function wrap_xmlrpc_server (from the original PHP api) has been implemented,
and a couple of bugs fixed in wrap_xmlrpc_method

All users are advised to upgrade.



JS-XMLRPC version 0.2 - 2007/04/25

I'm pleased to announce the second release of the js-xmlrpc library.

The big improvements are:
- support for async client requests (with an optional user-specified timeout)
- support for proxying remote methods into native javascript functions
- API documentation is now included in the distribution
- minifed (compact) version of the lib is now included in the distribution

Although there are no known bugs, a complete testsuite has not yet been developed
to insure formal correctness. Please consider the code beta quality, and report
any bugs you find to http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpxmlrpc



JS-XMLRPC version 0.1 - 2007/02/25

I'm pleased to announce the initial release of the js-xmlrpc library.

The documentation is quite scarce (read: nonexistent), but the code is in pretty
good shape.

The library has been designed with the goal of being 100% compatible with the
api of the PHP-XMLRPC library, language-specifics aside. You should be able to
read the documentation of php-xmlrpc and easily translate the examples in
javascript code. The docs can be found at:
http://phpxmlrpc.sourceforge.net/doc-2/

There are quite a few missing features in this initial release of the library,
the most notable ones being:
- support for async client requests (makes building interactive interfaces hard)
- support for user specified timeout in client requests
- support for transparent decoding of php objects / javascript objects

A (100% javascript) webservice debugger is included in the distribution. It should
be limited to send calls to the same webserver that is hosting it, so it is most
useful when deployed on the same webserver providing the target webservices.
